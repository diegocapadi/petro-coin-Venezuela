# petro-coin-Venezuela
el petro / creating a proposal for the Venezuelan concurrency  petro

Good morning all.
I want to thank the organizers, presenters, and attendees for their participation.  In regards the petro-coin (el petro) please do not confuse with the petrodollar which is another cryptocurrency which other than the Venezuela government invented.  The petro is in its design stage and open to recommendations. It is worth knowing that on December 29th the Venezuelan president officially approved five billion barrels of oil reserves that were internationally certified to back up "el petro" and last January fifth approved emission of 100 million petro to be used on an apparently ICO (Initial Coin Offering). The white paper was supposed to be ready by January 14th, but apparently is not ready. I think these oil barrel reserves can be sold as futures and right now the oil barrel price is $60. The government came up with this idea due to some international blockage to do some bank transactions in US dollars.
